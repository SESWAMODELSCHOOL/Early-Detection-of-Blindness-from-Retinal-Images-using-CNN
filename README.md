## Early Detection of Blindness from Retinal Images using CNN

This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the early detection of blindness from retinal images. The dataset to be used is from the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection competition on Kaggle, consisting of over 5,500 images labeled according to the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) on a scale from 0 (no DR) to 4 (severe DR). The project will leverage CNN architectures to accurately classify these retinal images, with the goal of optimizing accuracy, precision, and recall for early blindness detection. In addition, a web-based interface using Streamlit will be developed to allow users to upload retinal images and receive automated classification results for the level of DR.

## Repository Structure and Setup

This repository will contain code for data preprocessing, model development, training scripts, and the Streamlit-based user interface. All code versions will be tracked using GitHub. As the project progresses, instructions for setting up the environment and dependencies will be included. The dataset used is publicly available and anonymized, ensuring compliance with GDPR and other data protection regulations.
